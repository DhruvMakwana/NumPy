**NumPy is the fundamental package which stands for Numerical Python used for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:**
* a powerful N-dimensional array object
* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
*	tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
*	useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

# (Q) How to install NumPy?

For many users, especially on Windows, the easiest way to begin is to download one of these Python distributions, which include all the key packages:
*	Anaconda: A free distribution of Python with scientific packages. Supports Linux, Windows and Mac.
*	Enthought Canopy: The free and commercial versions include the core scientific packages. Supports Linux, Windows and Mac.
*	Python(x,y): A free distribution including scientific packages, based around the Spyder IDE. Windows and Ubuntu; Py2 only.
*	WinPython: Another free distribution including scientific packages and the Spyder IDE. Windows only, but more actively maintained and supports the latest Python 3 versions.
*	Pyzo: A free distribution based on Anaconda and the IEP interactive development environment. Supports Linux, Windows and Mac.

**Installing via pip**
</br> Most major projects upload official packages to the Python Package index. They can be installed on most operating systems using Python’s standard pip package manager.
</br>
</br>`pip install numpy`

## NumPy – A Replacement for MatLab</br>
NumPy is often used along with packages like SciPy (Scientific Python) and Mat−plotlib (plotting library). This combination is widely used as a replacement for MatLab, a popular platform for technical computing. However, Python alternative to MatLab is now seen as a more modern and complete programming language.
